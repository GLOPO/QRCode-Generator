## Overview

Having learnt Next.js and Tailwind CSS I dont think I can build a project using vanilla ever again

As I remincse my frontend journey and discover some loopholes or forgotten holes in my memory I dedcided to refresh by starting again by taking Frontendmentor.io learning path

This is a simple project (QR code generator) that requires only HTML and CSS with no single atom of JavaScript but like I said never going back

I am neither installing any dependencies not configuring my talwind since the style guide for this project is very minimal

Join me as I code.❤️😍👨‍💻👩‍💻🧑‍💻
.

This Project took me less than 1:30mins to complete
My advise to everyone out there is to keep on practicing
I completely forgot hot to integrate my TailwindCSS 😳🤔😪, like I noted earlier I am using Next.js
